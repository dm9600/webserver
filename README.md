## Webserver

CURRENT TODO: Implement https

My attempt at writing a web server from scratch. 

To run, just pull the entire thing and run 'ruby run.rb'. To test out different html/css/img, just modify the contents of the 'app' folder. You can also create your own servlets, and match a servlet with a route via the routes file in 'app'. The app folder contents here is just a sample I use for testing purposes.

The majority of the functionality is contained inside server.rb in lib.
